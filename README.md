# Showdown  ![umbreon](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/xyani/umbreon.gif)
A Pok√©mon battle-bot that can play battles on [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

The bot can play single battles in generations 3 through 8. However some of the battle mechanics assume it is gen8.

## Requirements 
- Python version: Developed and tested using Python 3.8.

# Getting Started

### ü§î A Note About Configurations:
Environment variables are used for configuration, by default they are read from a `.env` file.

There is a sample `.env` file provided in this repository.

As an example, here is a minimal `.env` file. This configuration will log in and search for a `gen8randombattle`:
```
WEBSOCKET_URI=sim.smogon.com:8000
PS_USERNAME=MyCoolUsername
PS_PASSWORD=MySuperSecretPassword
BOT_MODE=SEARCH_LADDER
POKEMON_MODE=gen8randombattle
RUN_COUNT=1
```


### Available configurations:

| Config Name | Type | Required | Default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **`BATTLE_BOT`** | string |  | `"safest"` | The BattleBot module to use. More on this below |
| **`SAVE_REPLAY`** | boolean |  | `False` | Specifies whether or not to save replays of the battles |
| **`LOG_LEVEL`** | string |  | `"DEBUG"` | Python logging level |
| **`WEBSOCKET_URI`** | string | yes | `"sim.smogon.com:8000"` | The address to use to connect to the Pokemon Showdown websocket |
| **`PS_USERNAME`** | string | yes |  | Pokemon Showdown username |
| **`PS_PASSWORD`** | string |  |  | Pokemon Showdown password |
| **`BOT_MODE`** | string | yes |  | The mode the the bot will operate in. Options are: `"CHALLENGE_USER"`, `"SEARCH_LADDER"`, or `"ACCEPT_CHALLENGE"` |
| **`USER_TO_CHALLENGE`** | string | yes* |  | Required if `BOT_MODE` is `"CHALLENGE_USER"`. User to challenge |
| **`TEAM_NAME`** | string | yes* |  | Required if the `POKEMON_MODE` is one where a team is required |
| **`RUN_COUNT`** | integer | yes |  | The amount of games this bot will play before quitting |
| **`ROOM_NAME`** | string |  |  | Optionally join a room by this name if BOT_MODE is "ACCEPT_CHALLENGE" |
| **`POKEMON_MODE`** | string | yes |  | The type of game this bot will play games in. |

## üî®  Running without Docker

**1. Clone**

Clone the repository with  `git clone https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown.git`

**2. Install Requirements**

Be sure to use a python virtual environment to isolate your packages. In the root folder of the project, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

**3. Run the Bot**

Specify the environment variables needed in `.env`, then run `python run.py` to deploy the bot.

**4. Check your Pokemon Showdown account**

You should see that the pokemon showdown account is playing.

## üê≥  Running with Docker
‚ö†Ô∏è This will require Docker 17.06 or higher

**1. Clone the repository**

`git clone https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown.git`

**2. Build the Docker image**

`docker build . -t showdown`

**3. Run with an environment variable file**

`docker run --env-file .env showdown`

**4. Check your Pokemon Showdown account**

You should see that the pokemon showdown account is playing.

# Types of Battle Bots

### Safest
use `BATTLE_BOT=safest` (default unless otherwise specified)

The bot searches through the game-tree for two turns and selects the move that minimizes the possible loss for a turn.

For decisions with random outcomes a weighted average is taken for all possible end states.
For example: If using draco meteor versus some arbitrary other move results in a score of 1000 if it hits (90%) and a score of 900 if it misses (10%), the overall score for using
draco meteor is (0.9 * 1000) + (0.1 * 900) = 990.

This is equivalent to the [Expectiminimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectiminimax) strategy.

This decision type is deterministic - the bot will always make the same move given the same situation again.

### Nash-Equilibrium (experimental)
use `BATTLE_BOT=nash_equilibrium`

Using the information it has, plus some assumptions about the opponent, the bot will attempt to calculate the [Nash-Equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium) with the highest payoff
and select a move from that distribution.

The Nash Equilibrium is calculated using command-line tools provided by the [Gambit](http://www.gambit-project.org/) project.
This decision method should only be used when running with Docker and will fail otherwise.

This decision method is **not** deterministic. The bot **may** make a different move if presented with the same situation again.

### Ou Scraped Teams (experimental)

use `BATTLE_BOT=ou_scraped_teams`

Only use with `POKEMON_MODE=gen8ou`. Using a file of OU sets & teams, this battle-bot is meant to have a better
understanding of Pokeon sets that may appear in gen8ou.

Still uses the `safest` decision making method for picking a move, but in theory the knowledge of sets should
result in better decision making.

### Most Damage
use `BATTLE_BOT=most_damage`

Selects the move that will do the most damage to the opponent

Does not switch

## Performance

These are the default battle-bot's results in three different formats for roughly 75 games played on a fresh account:

## Write your own bot
Create a package in `showdown/battle_bots` with a module named `main.py`. In this module, create a class named `BattleBot`, override the Battle class, and implement your own `find_best_move` function.

Set the `BATTLE_BOT` environment variable to the name of your package and your function will be called each time PokemonShowdown prompts the bot for a move

## The Battle Engine
The bots in the project all use a Pokemon battle engine to determine all possible transpositions that may occur from a pair of moves.

For more information, see [ENGINE.md](https://github.com/pmariglia/showdown/blob/master/ENGINE.md) 

## Specifying Teams
You can specify teams by setting the `TEAM_NAME` environment variable.
Examples can be found in `teams/teams/`.

Passing in a directory will cause a random team to be selected from that directory.

The path specified should be relative to `teams/teams/`.

#### Examples

Specify a file:
```
TEAM_NAME=gen8/ou/clef_sand
```

Specify a directory:
```
TEAM_NAME=gen8/ou
```
